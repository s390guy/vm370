 The intent of this manual is to provide a reference tool for programmers
 using PL360.  Although it is not a textbook, it has  been  organized  in
 such  a  way  that  each  section  introduces  new material dependent on
 information covered in preceding sections.  In that sense, it can  serve
 as a self-teaching aid.
 
 Those readers not familiar with Bacus-Naur  Form  (BNF),  may  find  the
 syntactic  rules  used to describe the language difficult to understand.
 However, the textual descriptions and examples associated with a set  of
 syntactic  rules  should serve to clarify those rules.  Also, the sample
 programs of Appendix A further clarify the language structure.
 
 Knowledge of the 360 architecture [4, 5 or  6]  is  a  prerequisite  for
 understanding  the language definition and some familiarity with the 360
 Assembly  Language  [7]  and  linkage  editor  [8]  is  assumed  in  the
 description of the object code produced by the compiler.
 
 In writing  this  manual,  the  authors  have  drawn  heavily  upon  the
 (anonymous)  PL360  Programming  Manual  published  by the University of
 Newcastle upon Tyne, Computing Laboratory [10].

 PL360 is a  programming  language  designed  specifically  for  the  IBM
 System/360 computers.  It provides the facilities for a symbolic machine
 language  but  displays  a structure similar to that of ALGOL.  A formal
 description of an earlier version of the language has been published  by
 Niklaus Wirth [1] who directed the development of the PL360 language and
 its  compiler at the Computer Science Department of Stanford University.
 Although  PL360  was   originally   designed   for   writing   logically
 self-contained programs, subsequent extensions permit communication with
 separately compiled programs.
 
 An efficient one pass "in core"  compiler,  written  by  Niklaus  Wirth,
 Joseph  W.  Wells, Jr.  and Edwin Satterthwaite, Jr., which incorporates
 these extensions is available through the Stanford Program Library  [2].
 This  compiler  translates  PL360 source code into object modules in the
 format required by  several  360  operating  systems  (OS  and  MTS  for
 example).   The  documentation issued with the compiler includes several
 amendments to the original language definition.  Further extensions were
 carried out at the University of Newcastle by James Eve.  These  changes
 [3,10]  were  aimed  primarily  at  relaxing  the linkage constraints on
 separately compiled programs, enabling for example direct  communication
 with  programs  using  OS/360  type  linkages.   Michael  Malcolm of the
 Stanford Computer Science Department made several modifications  to  the
 version of the compiler produced by James Eve.  These extensions made it
 possible  to  run the compiler and compiled programs under DOS operating
 systems.  Assembly language subroutines were also written  for  both  OS
 and  DOS to facilitate input-output with sequential tape and disk files.
 Dick Guertin of the Stanford Center for Information Processing  extended
 the  syntax of PL360, primarily to increase programming convenience.  He
 has also written assembly language interfaces to allow  interactive  use
 of   both  the  PL360  compiler  and  PL360  programs  under  the  ORVYL
 time-sharing monitor at Stanford.  Andrew Koening of Columbia University
 also contributed improvements to the compiler.
 
 The language  definition  and  compiler  description  incorporating  all
 changes  are  given  in  this  manual.   For  a  full  discussion of the
 background underlying the development of PL360 and a description of  the
 organization   and  development  of  the  compiler  together  with  some
 perceptive comments on the 360 architecture,  reference  must  still  be
 made to [1], where the aims of the language are summarized:
 
     ... it was decided to develop a tool which would:
     1.  allow full use  of  the  facilities  provided  by  the  360
         hardware,
     2.  provide convenience in writing and correcting programs, and
     3.  encourage the user to write in a clear  and  comprehensible
         style.
 
     As a consequence of 3, it was felt that programs should not  be
     able  to  modify  themselves.   The  language  should  have the
     facilities  necessary  to  express  compiler   and   supervisor
     programs,  and the programmer should be able to determine every
     detailed machine operation.

 2.1 Terminology, Notation, and Basic Definitions
+2.1 Terminology, Notation, and Basic Definitions
+2.1 Terminology, Notation, and Basic Definitions
 
 The language is defined in terms of a computer which is comprised  of  a
 number  of  processing units and a finite set of storage elements.  Each
 of the storage elements holds a content,  also  called  value.   At  any
 given  time, certain significant relationships may exist between storage
 elements and values.  These relationships may be recognized and altered,
 and new values may be created by  the  processing  units.   The  actions
 taken  by  the  processors  are  determined  by  a  program.  The set of
 possible programs form the language.  A program is composed of, and  can
 therefore  be  decomposed into elementary constructions according to the
 rules  of  a  syntax,  or  grammar.   To  each  elementary  construction
 corresponds an elementary action specified as a  semantic  rule  of  the
 language.  The action denoted by a program is defined as the sequence of
 elementary  actions  corresponding to the elementary constructions which
 are obtained when the program is decomposed  (parsed)  by  reading  from
 left to right.
 
 
 2.1.1 The Processor
+2.1.1 The Processor
+2.1.1 The Processor
 
 At any time, the state of the processor is described by  a  sequence  of
 bits  called  the  program status word (PSW).  The status word contains,
 among other information,  a  pointer  to  the  next  instruction  to  be
 executed, and a quantity which is called the condition code.
 
 Storage elements are classified into registers and  core  memory  cells,
 simply  called  cells.  Registers are divided into three types according
 to their size and the operations which can be performed on their values.
 The types of registers are:
 
     a.  integer or logical (a sequence of 32 bits)
     b.  real (a sequence of 32 bits)
     c.  long real (a sequence of 64 bits)
 
 Cells are classified into five types according to  their  size  and  the
 type  of  value  which  they  may  contain.  A cell may be structured or
 simple.  The types of simple values and simple cells are:
 
     a.  byte or character (a sequence of 8 bits = 1 byte)
     b.  short integer (a sequence of 16 bits = 2 bytes, interpreted
         as an integer in two's complement binary notation)
     c.  integer or logical (a  sequence  of  32  bits  =  4  bytes,
         interpreted  as  an  integer  in  two's  complement  binary
         notation)
     d.  real (a sequence of 32 bits = 4  bytes,  interpreted  as  a
         base-16 floating-point number)
     e.  long real (a sequence of 64 bits = 8 bytes, interpreted  as
         a base-16 floating-point number)
 
 The types integer and logical are treated as equivalent in the language,
 and consequently only one of them, namely  integer,  will  be  mentioned
 throughout this manual.  Likewise, byte and character are equivalent and
 only byte is mentioned.

 2.1.2 Relationships
+2.1.2 Relationships
+2.1.2 Relationships
 
 The most fundamental relationship is that which exists  between  a  cell
 and  its value.  It is known as containment; the cell is said to contain
 the value.
 
 Another relationship exists between the cells which are  the  components
 of  a  structured cell, called an array, and the structured cell itself.
 It  is  known  as  subordination.   Structured  cells  are  regarded  as
 containing the ordered set of the values of the component cells.
 
 A set of relationships between values is defined by monadic  and  dyadic
 functions  or  operations,  which  the  processor is able to evaluate or
 perform.  The relationships are defined by mappings between  values  (or
 pairs  of values) known as the operands, and values known as the results
 of the evaluation.  These mappings are not  precisely  defined  in  this
 manual; instead, see [6].
 
 
 2.1.3 The Program
+2.1.3 The Program
+2.1.3 The Program
 
 A program contains declarations and statements.  Declarations  serve  to
 list  the  cells,  registers, procedures, and other quantities which are
 involved in the algorithm described by the  program,  and  to  associate
 names, called identifiers, with them.  Statements specify the operations
 to be performed on these quantities, to which they refer through the use
 of identifiers.
 
 A program is a sequence of tokens, which are basic symbols,  strings  or
 comments.   Every  token  is  itself  a  sequence  of  characters.   The
 following conventions are used:
 
     a.  Basic  symbols  constitute  the  basic  vocabulary  of  the
         language (cf.  2.2.2).  They are either single  characters,
         or uppercase letter sequences.
     b.  Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quote marks
         i.e.  "string"  (cf.  3.4).
     c.  Comments are sequences  of  characters  (not  containing  a
         semicolon)   preceded  by  the  basic  symbol  COMMENT  and
         followed by a semicolon (;).  Comments may also be  written
         as  a  sequence  of  characters  between vertical bars (!).
         Thus, ! this is a comment ! It is understood that  comments
         have no effect on the execution of a program.
 
 In order that a sequence of tokens be an executable program, it must  be
 constructed according to the rules of the syntax.
 
 
 2.1.4 Syntax
+2.1.4 Syntax
+2.1.4 Syntax
 
 A sequence of tokens constitutes an instance of a syntactic  entity  (or
 construct),  if  that  entity can be derived from the sequence by one or
 more  applications  of  syntactic  substitution  rules.   In  each   such
 application,  the  sequence  equal  to  the  right  side  of the rule is
 replaced by the symbol which is its left side.

 Syntactic entities (cf.   Appendix  D, E)  are denoted by english  words
 enclosed  in  brackets  < and >.  These words describe approximately the
 nature of the syntactic entity, and where these words are used  elsewhere
 in  the  text,  they  refer  to  that  syntactic entity.  For reasons of
 notational convenience and brevity, the uppercase letters A,  K,  and  T
 are  also  used  in the denotation of syntactic entities.  They stand as
 abbreviations for any of the following words (or pairs):
 
             A                K                T
+            A                K                T
+            A                K                T
 
         long real        long real        long real
         real             real             real
         integer          integer          integer
         short integer                     short integer
                                           byte
 
 Syntactic rules are of the form <E> ::=  &  where  <E>  is  a  syntactic
 entity  (called  the left side) and & is a finite sequence of tokens and
 syntactic entities (called the right side of the rule).  The notation

 is used as an abbreviation for the n syntactic rules

 If in the denotations of constituents of the rule the uppercase  letters
 A,  K, or T occur more than once, they must be replaced consistently, or
 possibly according to further rules given in the accompanying text.   As

 An identifier is a K-register, T-cell, procedure, function,  or  integer
 value  identifier,  if  it  has  respectively  been  associated  with  a
 K-register,  T-cell,  procedure,  function,  or  integer value (called a
 quantity) in one of the blocks surrounding  its  occurrence  (cf.  4.1).
 This   association  is  achieved  by  an  appropriate  declaration.  The
 identifier is said to designate the associated  quantity.  If  the  same
 identifier   is  associated  with  more  than  one  quantity,  then  the
 considered occurrence designates the quantity to which it was associated
 in the innermost block embracing the considered occurrence. In  any  one
 block,  an  identifier  must be associated with exactly one quantity. In
 the parse of a program, that association determines which of  the  rules
 given above applies.
 
 Any processing computer  and  operating  system  can  be  considered  to
 provide  an  environment  in which the program is embedded, and in which
 some identifiers are permanently declared.  Some identifiers are assumed
 to be known in every environment; they are called standard  identifiers,
 and are listed in Section 2.2.3.

 are  denoted  by  the same letter sequences without further distinction.
 Such letter sequences are called reserved words and cannot  be  used  as

     <hexadecimal value> ::= # <hexadecimal digit>
                           ! <hexadecimal value> <hexadecimal digit>
 
 A hexadecimal value denotes a sequence of bits.  Each hexadecimal  digit
 stands for a sequence of four bits defined as follows:
 
       0 = 0000    4 = 0100    8 = 1000    C = 1100
       1 = 0001    5 = 0101    9 = 1001    D = 1101
       2 = 0010    6 = 0110    A = 1010    E = 1110
       3 = 0011    7 = 0111    B = 1011    F = 1111
 
 Note:  If hexadecimal values are used in conjunction with arithmetic  or
 logical operators in a program, they must be considered as a sequence of
 bits  which  constitute  the  computer's representation of the number on
 which the operator is  applied.   Hexadecimal  values  followed  by  the
 letter   R   or  L  may  be  used  to  denote  numbers  in  unnormalized
 floating-point representation [4,5,6].

 Integer,  real,  and  long  real  numbers  are  represented  in  decimal
 notation.  The latter two can be followed by a scale factor denoting  an
 integral power of 10.  Short integers are distinguished from integers by
 the  letter  S  following  the  number.   In  order to denote a negative
 number, an unsigned number is preceded by  the  underscore  symbol  "_".
 (Note:  the underscore is used so as not to confuse negative values with
 the subtract operator "-", which is never part of a number.)
 
 Note:  A-number is an abbreviation for  long real number,  real  number,
 short integer number and integer number as defined in section 2.1.4 as a
 notational convenience.

 When a string is a character  sequence  enclosed  in  quote  marks,  the
 string  is limited to a total of 255 characters.  If a quote mark (") is
 to be a character of the sequence,  it  is  represented  by  a  pair  of
 consecutive quote marks.
 
 When a string is a hexadecimal value ending in X, up to  16  hexadecimal
 digits may be specified.  Each pair of hexadecimal digits represents one
 character.   If  the  number  of  hexadecimal digits specified is odd, a
 hexadecimal 0 is prefixed to the specified value to make the total even.
 
 Examples:  "ABC"          denotes the sequence  ABC
            "A""Z"         denotes the sequence  A"Z
            #C1C2C3X       denotes the sequence  ABC

 where the  D's  stand  for  declarations  and  the  S's  for  statements

 main purposes of a block are:
 
     1.  To enclose a sequence of statements into a structural  unit
         which  as a whole is classified as a simple statement.  The
         constituent statements are executed in sequence  from  left
         to right.
     2.  To introduce new quantities and associate identifiers  with
         them.   These  identifiers  may  be  used to refer to these
         quantities in any of the declarations and statements within
         the block, but are not known outside the block.
 
 The symbol NULL denotes a simple statement which implies  no  action  at
 all.

     END
 
 The addressing mechanism of the 360 computers is such that  instructions
 can  indicate  addresses  only relative to a base address contained in a
 register.  The programmer must insure that
 
     1.  every address in the program specifies a "base" register
     2.  the specified register is loaded with the appropriate  base
         address  whenever an instruction whose address refers to it
         is executed
     3.  the difference d between the desired absolute  address  and
         the available base address satisfies 0 <= d < 4096
 
 This scheme  not  only  increases  the  amount  of  'clerical'  work  in
 programming,  but  also constitutes a rich source of pitfalls.  PL360 is
 designed to ease the tedious task of base  address  assignment,  and  to
 provide checking facilities against errors.
 
 The solution adopted here is that of program segmentation.  The  program
 is  subdivided  into  individual parts, called segments.  Every quantity
 defined within the program is known by the  number  of  the  segment  in
 which  it  occurs and by its displacement relative to the origin of that
 segment.  The problem then  consists  of  subdividing  the  program  and
 choosing base registers in such a way that
 
     a.  the compiler knows which register is used as base for  each
         compiled address
     b.  the compiler can assure that each  base  register  contains
         the desired base address during execution
     c.  the number  of  times  base  addresses  are  reloaded  into
         registers is reasonably small
 
 It was decided [1] that the programmer should express  explicitly  which
 parts  of  the program are to constitute segments.  The program may then
 be organized in a way that  minimizes  the  number  of  cross-references
 between segments.
 
 It should be noted that a programmer's knowledge about segment sizes and
 occurrences of cross-reference is quite different for programs than  for
 data.   In the latter case the programmer is aware of the precise amount
 of storage needed for the declared quantities, and knows precisely where
 in the program references to a specific  data  segment  occur.   In  the
 former  case,  knowledge  about  the eventual size of a compiled program
 section is only vague, and the programmer is sometimes  unaware  of  the
 occurrence  of branch instructions implicit in certain constructs of the
 language.  It was therefore decided  [1]  to  treat  programs  and  data
 differently;  this  decision  also  conformed  with  the desirability of
 keeping program and data apart as separate entities.

 4.2  Program Segmentation
+4.2  Program Segmentation
+4.2  Program Segmentation
 
 A program segment corresponds to a  CSECT  in  assembly  language.   The
 outermost  block of a program is always compiled as a segment.  Since by
 its very nature control lies in exactly one segment at any instant,  one
 register  is  designated to hold the base address of the program segment
 currently executing.  Register R15 is  usually  used  for  this  purpose
 (however,   cf.   8.1,   10.1.5).    Branching  to  another  segment  is
 accomplished with a procedure statement which causes the program segment
 base register of the destination segment to  be  loaded  with  its  base
 address before branching into that segment (cf. 8.2).
 
 The natural unit for a program segment is the procedure (cf. 8.1).   The
 normal  way to enter a procedure is via a procedure statement (cf. 8.2),
 and the normal way to leave it is at its end, or by a  call  to  another
 procedure  which  does not return.  An explicit GOTO statement cannot be
 used for branching from one segment to  another,  but  may  be  used  to
 branch  out  of  a  local  procedure within a segment.  The fact that no
 implicitly generated instructions can ever lead  control  outside  of  a
 segment minimizes the number of cross references in a natural way.  Only
 relatively  large  procedures  should constitute program segments, and a
 facility  is  provided  to  designate  such  procedures  explicitly.   A
 procedure to be compiled as a program segment must  contain  the  symbol
 SEGMENT or GLOBAL in its heading.
 
 
 4.3  Data Segmentation
+4.3  Data Segmentation
+4.3  Data Segmentation
 
 For data, the programmer is aware of the  precise  amount  of  allocated
 memory  and  of  the  instances  where  references  are  made  to  these
 quantities.   A  base declaration was therefore introduced which implies
 that all quantities  declared  thereafter  within  the  same  block  and
 preceding  another  base declaration, refer to the specified register as
 their base.  These quantities form a data segment.  At the place of  the
 base  declaration,  an  instruction is compiled which loads the register
 with the appropriate segment address (except for dummy base declarations
 and BASE R0); however, its  previous  contents  are  neither  saved  nor
 restored upon exit from the block.
 
 Data segments declared in parallel (i.e., not nested) blocks, can safely
 refer to the same base register.  Data segments declared within the same
 block usually refer to different base registers.  Data segments declared
 within nested blocks should also refer to different base registers.   If
 they  do  not,  it is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the
 register is appropriately loaded when a segment is addressed.
 
 There is no limit to the size of data segments.   All  cell  identifiers
 must,  however,  refer  to cells whose addresses differ from the segment
 base address by less than 4096.  If they do not, the  compiler  provides
 an appropriate diagnostic.

 4.4  Main Program
+4.4  Main Program
+4.4  Main Program
 
 A PL360 program which is a block is  considered  to  be  embedded  in  a
 global procedure such as the following:  (cf.  8.1)
 
       GLOBAL PROCEDURE SEGN001 (R14) BASE R15;
       BEGIN  STM(R14,R12,B13(12));  R14 := R13;
          BEGIN  GLOBAL DATA SEGN000 BASE R13;
                    ARRAY 18 INTEGER B13;
             B13(4) := R14;  B14(8) := R13;
             B14(16) := B14(16) XOR B14(16);
 
             BEGIN  COMMENT  Main program block;
             END;
 
             R13 := B13(4);  LM(R14,R12,B13(12));
          END;
       END.
 
 The 18  integer  area  is  reserved  to  conform  to  procedure  calling
 conventions (cf. 9.1). If the PL360 program is a global procedure, there
 is no implicit base declaration for the data area (cf. 4.3).
 
 
 When a program is defined as a block, the compiler supplies  a  transfer
 address for the linkage editor or loader [9], and provides the necessary
 entry  and  exit  code for linking with a standard operating system (cf.
 10.1.3).
 
 When a program is defined as a global procedure, no transfer address  is
 supplied, and all linkage code must be written by the programmer.
 
 Both types of program are included in the sample programs of Appendix A.

 The System/360 processor has 16 registers which contain integer  numbers
 and are said to be of type integer (or logical).  They are designated by
 the standard register identifiers:  R0 through R15  (cf.  2.2.3).
 
 The processor also has four registers which contain real numbers or long
 real numbers.  If those registers are  used  in  conjunction  with  real
 numbers,  they  are  said  to be of type real, and are designated by the
 standard register identifiers:
 
               F0, F2, F4, F6
 
 If they are used in conjunction with long real numbers, they are said to
 be of type long real,  and  are  designated  by  the  standard  register
 identifiers:
 
               F01, F23, F45, F67
 
 The above register identifiers are assumed to be predeclared,  and other
 identifiers can  be  associated  with  these  registers.   Reference  to
 specific registers in the text apply to register synonyms also.

          COMMON ! DUMMY
     <segment close declaration> ::= CLOSE BASE
 
 A segment base declaration causes the  compiler  to  use  the  specified
 register  as the base address for the cells subsequently declared in the
 block in which the base declaration occurs.  The segment  is  terminated
 either  by  the  END  of  the block or by the subsequent appearance of a
 segment close declaration.  Upon entrance to this block, the appropriate
 base address is assigned to the specified base register except  for  the
 dummy  base  declaration and base declarations that specify BASE R0 (cf.
 4.3).
 
 If the symbol DATA is preceded by any of the symbols GLOBAL, EXTERNAL or
 COMMON, the corresponding identifier is associated with the data segment
 to enable linking of segments  in  different  PL360  programs  [8,9,12].

 Note:  Dummy base declarations permit  the  description  of  data  areas
 which  are  created  during  the  execution  of  the PL360 program.  Any
 integer register may be specified in a dummy base declaration.  When  R0
 (or  a  synonym  to  R0)  is  specified  in  any  base  declaration, the
 subsequent identifiers are understood to have displacements and no  base
 register (or index register).

 A cell declaration introduces identifiers and associates them with cells
 of a specified type belonging to the currently active  base  declaration
 segment  (cf.  4.3).  The scope of validity of these cell identifiers is
 the block in whose heading the declaration occurs (cf.  4.1).  Moreover,
 a declaration may specify the assignment of  an  initial  value  to  the
 introduced  cell.  This assignment is understood to have occurred before
 execution of the program.
 
 A cell may be  initialized  to  numeric  values,  strings,  relative  or
 absolute addresses.  The number of bytes appropriate for the type of the
 declared  cell  is  taken for each (numeric) T-value.  Strings are never
 expanded or truncated;  each character of the string occupies  one byte,
 initialization  starting  with  the  leftmost  byte.  A short integer or
 integer type cell can be initialized to the relative address (i.e., base
 register and displacement) corresponding to a T-cell  identifier  or  to
 the   relative  (entry  point)  address  corresponding  to  a  procedure
 identifier by means of the @ operator.  The @ operator also permits  the
 initialization  of an integer type cell with the relative address (i.e.,
 index register, base register and displacement) of a T-cell  designator.
 The  @@  operator  enables  integer  type  cells  to be initialized with
 absolute addresses corresponding to T-cell identifiers or to  the  entry
 point of procedure identifiers.
 
 If a simple type is preceded by the symbol ARRAY and an  integer  value,
 say  n  , then the declared cell is an array (ordered set) of n cells of
 the specified simple type.  An initial value list with m  <=  n  entries
 specifies  the  initial  values of the first m elements of the array.  A
 list may be specified as a list of sublists.  Repetition of  a  sequence
 of  elements  may  be  specified  by making the sequence into a list and
 preceding it by an integer value, say k , specifying the number of times
 the list is to be used.  If no integer value precedes a list, it is used
 once.  Absolute addresses may not occur in lists where k > 1 .   Integer
 values n and k must be positive.

 Note:  Boundary alignment is performed for a cell declaration (according
 to the simple type)  and  not  for  each  initializing  value.   Because
 strings  are never expanded or truncated, care is needed in initializing
 with combinations of strings and other values.

         ! <integer register expression>

         ! <integer register expression> - <integer value expression>
     <integer register expression> ::= <integer register>
         ! <integer register> + <integer register>
     <integer value expression> ::= <integer value>
         ! <integer value expression> + <integer value>
         ! <integer value expression> - <integer value>
 
 Note:  The second form of <T-cell designator> may be  specified  at  any
 time, but only has meaning for the first <T-cell designator> of
 
     <T-cell assignment> ::= <T-cell designator> := <T-cell value>
 and
     <condition> ::= <T-cell designator> <relation> <T-cell value>
 
 In these two cases, the integer value expression following the slash (/)
 specifies the number of bytes to be moved or compared (cf.  6.3, 6.5).
 
 Cells are denoted by cell designators.  The designator for a  particular
 cell  consists  of  the identifier associated with that cell, optionally
 followed by an index or  index/length.   When  an  index  is  used,  the
 address  of  the designated cell is taken as the address associated with
 the cell identifier plus the value of the index.  If a length is  to  be
 specified  when  no  index  is  required,  an  index  value of 0 must be
 specified before the slash; e.g., cell(0/length).
 
 Note:  Register R0 or synonym (cf 5.1) must not be specified as an index
 constituent.  Depending upon the function with which the cell designator
 is used and the declaration of the cell identifier, the index  may  have
 0,  1 or 2 integer register constituents.  If the cell identifier has no
 base register associated with it, then the first  integer  register  (if
 any)  in  the  index is understood to be the base register.  If the cell
 identifier has a base register  associated  with  it,  and  the  context
 permits  an  index  register,  then  an integer register in the index is
 taken as an index register.  If the identifier has  no  associated  base
 register  and  the  context permits indexing, then two integer registers
 may appear in the index and they are understood to be the base  register
 and index register, respectively.

           <T-cell synonym> , <identifier><synonymous cell>
     <synonymous cell> ::= SYN <T-cell designator> ! SYN <integer value>
 
 Cell synonyms serve to associate synonymous identifiers with  previously
 (i.e., preceding in the text) declared cells.  The types associated with
 the synonymous cell identifiers need not necessarily agree.
 
 If a synonymous cell is specified by an integer value, then that integer
 value represents the displacement (and possibly the  base  register  and
 index register) part of the cell's machine address.
 
 Examples:    INTEGER a16 SYN a(16)
              ARRAY 32768 SHORT INTEGER memory SYN 0
              INTEGER timer SYN #50
 
 The following example defines the standard integer identifiers:
 
     INTEGER MEM SYN 0,          B5 SYN MEM(R5),     B10 SYN MEM(R10),
             B1 SYN MEM(R1),     B6 SYN MEM(R6),     B11 SYN MEM(R11),
             B2 SYN MEM(R2),     B7 SYN MEM(R7),     B12 SYN MEM(R12),
             B3 SYN MEM(R3),     B8 SYN MEM(R8),     B13 SYN MEM(R13),
             B4 SYN MEM(R4),     B9 SYN MEM(R9),     B14 SYN MEM(R14),
                                                     B15 SYN MEM(R15),
 
 
 Note:   The  synonym  declaration  can  be  used  to  associate  several
 different types with a single cell.   Each  type  is  connected  with  a
 distinct identifier.
 
 Example:      LONG REAL x = #4E0000000000000L
               INTEGER xlow SYN x(4)
 
 A conversion operation from  a  number  of  type  integer  contained  in
 register  R0 to a number of type long real contained in register F01 can
 now be denoted by
 
               xlow := R0;  F01 := F01 - F01 + x;
 
 and a conversion vice-versa by
 
         F01 := F01 ++ #4E00000000000000L;  x := F01;  R0 := xlow;
 
 No initialization can be achieved by a synonym declaration.

     <syn cell value> ::= <T-cell designator> - <T-cell designator>
 
 Integer value synonyms  serve  to  associate  identifiers  with  integer
 values.   These  integer values are computed at the time the declaration
 is parsed and the identifiers thus associated can subsequently  be  used
 as  integer  values  (cf.  2.2.1, 3.3).  When the difference of two cell
 designators is specified, the cell identifiers must both have  the  same
 base  register  (cf.   5.2).   The  difference  between  their  relative
 locations  within  the segment is taken as the associated integer value.
 The cell designators  must  not  use  index  registers.   The  scope  of
 validity  of  these  integer  synonyms is the block in whose heading the
 declaration occurs (cf.  4.1).
 
 See sections 6.1 and 6.2 for definitions of monadic, arithmetic, logical
 and shift operators.

     <T-primary> ::= <T-value> ! <T-cell designator>

 A primary is either a value or the contents  of  a  designated  cell  or
 register.

          <integer register> := @ <T-cell designator> !
          <integer register> := @ <procedure identifier>
 
 A simple register assignment is said to specify the  register  appearing
 to  the  left  of  the  assignment  operator  (:=).  To this register is
 assigned the value designated by the  construct  to  the  right  of  the
 assignment  symbol.   That  designated  value  may  be  obtained through
 execution of a monadic operation specified by a monadic operator.
 
     <monadic operator> ::= ABS ! NEG ! NEG ABS
 
 The monadic operations are taking the absolute  value,  sign  inversion,
 and sign inversion after taking the absolute value.
 
 If a string is assigned to a register, that string must consist  of  not
 more   than  four  characters.   If  it  consists  of  fewer  than  four
 characters, null characters (#00X) are  appended  at  the  left  of  the
 string.   The  bit  representation  of  characters  is defined in EBCDIC
 [4,5,6].
 
 The construction with the symbol @ is used to assign  to  the  specified
 register the address of the designated cell or the entry  point  address
 of the procedure.

     <logical operator> ::= AND ! OR ! XOR
     <shift operator> ::= SHLL ! SHLA ! SHRL ! SHRA
 
 A register assignment is said to specify  the  same  register  which  is
 specified  by  the simple register assignment or the register assignment
 from which it is derived.   To  this  register  is  assigned  the  value
 obtained  by  applying  a  dyadic  operator to the current value of that
 specified register and the value of the primary following the  operator.
 The   operations  are  the  arithmetic  operations  of  addition  (+)  ,
 subtraction (-) , multiplication (*) , and division (/)  ,  the  logical
 operations  of  conjunction  (AND),  exclusive and inclusive disjunction
 (XOR, OR), and those of shifting to the left and right,  as  implemented
 in   the  System/360.   The  operators  ++  and  --  denote  logical  or
 unnormalized  addition  and  subtraction  when  applied  to  integer  or
 real/long  real  registers  respectively.   When  an  integer  value  is
 specified following a shift operator, it must be  nonnegative  and  less
 than  31.   The  reverse-assignment  operator  (=:)  specifies  that the
 contents of the assigned register are to be stored in  the  register  or
 cell following the operator.
 
 Examples of register assignments:
 
               R0  := R3
               R1  := 10 * x =: x
               R10 := i + age - R3 AND size(8)
               R9  := R8 AND R7 SHLL 8 OR R6
               F2  := 3.1416
               F0  := quant(R1) * price(R1)
               F45 := F23 + F01
 
 
 Note: 1.  The syntax implies  that  sequences  of  operators,  including
           assignment, are executed strictly from left to right.  Thus
               R1  := R2 + R1
           is not equivalent to
               R1  := R1 + R2
           but rather to the two statements
               R1  := R2; R1 := R1 + R1 .
           This  single  aspect  of  PL360  provides  many  pitfalls  for
           beginners.
 
       2.  Multiplication and division with integer operands can only  be
           specified with a multiplicand or dividend register Rn, where n
           is odd.  The register Rm with m = n-1 is then used to hold the
           extension   to   the   left   of   the  product  and  dividend
           respectively.  In the case of division, register  Rm  will  be
           assigned the resulting remainder.

                     R4 participates in the division and contains the

 In the first assignment, the value in the K-register is assigned to  the

 types are indicated in Table 6.1.  Cells may be indexed.
 
 In the second assignment, the T-cell, T-value or string is  assigned  to
 the   designated  T-cell.   The  third  form  is  a  logical  assignment
 expression in which the assigned cell is  logically  combined  with  the
 specified T-cell, T-value or string.  Cell designations must not include
 an  index register (cf.  5.4).  For cell to cell, the cell types must be
 identical or the assigned cell must include a length specification  (cf.
 5.4).   For  string  to cell, the entire string is moved to or logically
 combined with the assigned cell regardless of cell type when a length is
 not specified, or the shorter of the string length or  specified  length
 is  used.   For  value  to  cell, the allowable combinations of cell and
 value are indicated in the following table:

16.4  GOTO Statements and Labels
+6.4  GOTO Statements and Labels
+6.4  GOTO Statements and Labels
 
     <GOTO statement> ::= GOTO <identifier>
 
 The interpretation of a GOTO statement proceeds with the following steps:
 
     1.  Consider the innermost block containing the GOTO statement.
     2.  If the identifier designates a  program  point  within  the
         considered  block,  then  program execution resumes at that
         point.
     3.  Otherwise, execution of the block is regarded as terminated
         and the innermost block surrounding it is considered.
     4.  If this block  is  in  the  same  program  segment  as  the
         previous blocks, then step 2 is repeated.
     5.  Otherwise, the identifier is undefined (cf. 4.2).
 
 Label definitions serve to label points in a block.  The  identifier  of
 the  label  definition is said to designate the point in the block where
 the label definition occurs.  GOTO statements may refer to  such  points
 (cf.   4.1).   The identifier can be chosen freely, with the restriction
 that no two points in the same block  may  be  designated  by  the  same
 identifier.

     <condition> ::= <T-cell designator> <relation> <T-cell value>
                   ! <byte cell designator>
                   ! ¬ <byte cell designator>
                   ! <K-register> <relation> <A-primary>
                   ! <integer register> <relation> <string>
                   ! <relation>
                   ! <integer value>
                   ! ¬ <integer value>
     <relation> ::=  = ! ¬= ! < ! <= ! >= ! >
 
 A condition is said to be met or not met.  In the first  condition,  the
 T-cell  preceding  the  relation  is compared to the T-cell, T-value, or
 string  specified  after  the  relation.   The  comparison  is   logical
 (unsigned).   The  condition  is  met  if  the  specified relation holds
 between the values of the compared quantities.   The  same  restrictions
 apply  regarding  combinations  allowable as apply to the second form of
 T-cell assignment (cf.  Table 6.2).  A condition  specified  as  a  byte
 cell  (or  a  byte  cell preceded by ¬ ) is met if the value of the byte
 cell is #FF (or not  #FF).   The  condition  consisting  of  a  relation
 enclosed  by  a  register and a primary is met if the specified relation
 holds between the current values of the register and the primary.   When
 an  integer  register is compared to a string, the comparison is logical
 (unsigned),  and  the  string  must  consist  of  not  more  than   four
 characters.  If it consists of fewer than four characters, the string is
 right  justified  and null characters (#00X) are prefixed at the left to
 form a four character string.  The condition is  met  if  the  specified
 relation  holds  between  the  register  and  the  string.   A condition
 consisting of only a relation is  met  if  the  condition  code  of  the
 processor  (cf.   2.1.1) is in a state specified by the symbols of Table
 6.3 on the following page.  A condition consisting of an  integer  value
 (or an integer value preceded by ¬ ) is met if the condition code of the
 processor  is  in  a  state (or not in a state) specified by summing the
 integer components from Table 6.3 to arrive  at  the  specified  integer
B                                 6-4
1value.   Table  6.3  also contains predeclared integer value identifiers
 which may be used as specified (or preceded by ¬ to  obtain  all  states
 except the specified state).

   <stat condition> ::= <condition>
                      ! <statement> ; <condition>
 
 A compound condition is either of the form c1 AND c2 AND c3 ...  AND  cn
 which  is  said to be met, if and only if all the constituent conditions
 are met, or of the form c1 OR c2 OR c3 ...  OR cn which is  said  to  be
 met,  if  and only if at least one of the constituent conditions is met.
 Note that each condition may be prefaced by a statement and  semi-colon.
 In such a case, the statement is done before the associated condition is
 tested.

+6.6  IF Statements
 
     <IF statement> ::= <if clause> <statement>
          ! <if clause> <true part> <statement>
     <if clause> ::= IF <compound condition> THEN
     <true part> ::= <simple statement> ELSE
 
 The IF statement specifies the conditional execution of statements:
 
         <if clause> <statement>
 
 The statement is executed, if and only if the compound condition of  the
 clause is met.
 
         <if clause> <true part> <statement>
 
 The simple statement of the true part is executed and the  statement  is
 skipped,  if and only if the compound condition of the if clause is met.
 Otherwise the true part is skipped and the  statement  is  executed.   A
 simple statement is any statement except an IF, WHILE or FOR statement.
 
 Examples:   IF R0 < 10 THEN R1 := 1
             IF F2 > _3.75 AND F2 < 3.75 THEN F0 := F2 ELSE F0 := 0R
             IF < THEN SET(flags(1)) ELSE SET(flags(2))
 
 
 Note:  If the condition consists of just a relation  or  integer  value,
 then  the  decision  is  made  on  the  basis  of  the condition code as
 determined by a previous instructions.
 
 Examples:  EX(R1,CLC(0,B2,B3));  IF = THEN ...
            IF  TM(#80,flags);  ON  THEN ...

     <WHILE statement> ::= <while clause><statement>
     <while clause> ::= WHILE <compound condition> DO
 
 The WHILE statement denotes the repeated execution  of  a  statement  as
 long as the compound condition in the while clause is met.
 
 Examples:  WHILE F0 < prize(R1) DO R1 := R1 + 4
            WHILE R0 < 10 DO
            BEGIN R0 := R0 + 1;  F01 := F01 * F01;  F23 := F23 * F01;
            END

 6.8  FOR Statements
+6.8  FOR Statements
+6.8  FOR Statements
 
     <FOR statement> ::= <for clause><statement>
     <for clause> ::= FOR <integer register assignment> STEP <increment>
                      UNTIL <limit> DO
     <increment> ::= <integer value>
     <limit> ::= <integer primary> ! <short integer primary>
 
 The FOR statement specifies the repeated execution of a statement, while
 the content of the integer register specified by the assignment  in  the
 for  clause  takes  on  the  values  of an arithmetic progression.  That
 register is called  the  control  register.   The  execution  of  a  FOR
 statement occurs in the following steps:
 
     1.  the register assignment in the for clause is executed;
     2.  if the increment is not negative (negative),  then  if  the
         value  of  the  control  register is not greater (not less)
         than  the  limit,  the  process  continues  with  step   3;
         otherwise the execution of the FOR statement is terminated;
     3.  the statement following the for clause is executed;
     4.  the increment is added to the  control  register,  and  the
         process resumes with step 2.
 
 
 Examples:  FOR R1 := 0 STEP 1 UNTIL n DO STC(R1,lines(R1))
            FOR R2 := R1 STEP 4 UNTIL R0 DO
                   BEGIN F23 := quant(R2) * price(R2);
                       F01 := F01 + F23;
                   END

     <case sequence> ::= <case clause> BEGIN !
           <case sequence><statement> ;
     <case clause> ::= CASE <integer register> OF
 
 CASE statements permit the selection of one of a sequence of  statements
 according  to  the  current  value  of  the integer register (other than
 register R0) specified in the case clause.  The statement whose  ordinal
 number  (starting with 1) is equal to the register value is selected for
 execution, and the other statements in the sequence  are  ignored.   The
 value of that register is thereby modified.
 
 Example:  CASE R1 OF
           BEGIN COMMENT interpretation of instruction code R1;
               F01 := F01 + F23;
               F01 := F01 - F23;
               F01 := F01 * F23;
               F01 := F01 / F23;
               F01 := NEG F01;
               F01 := ABS F01;
           END

 Various data manipulation facilities  in  the  360  computer  cannot  be
 expressed  by  an assignment.  To make these facilities available in the
 language, the function statement is  introduced  (cf.   7.2),  using  an
 identifier   to  designate  an  individual  computer  instruction.   The
 function declaration serves to associate this identifier, which  thereby
 becomes  a  function  identifier,  with the desired computer instruction
 code, and to define the instruction fields which correspond from left to
 right to the parameters given in function statements.  The  format  code
 defines  the  format  of  the  instruction according to Table 7.1 on the
 following page.  The last two bytes of the instruction code  define  the
 first  two  bytes of the instruction.  The following example defines the
 standard function identifiers, which apart from  TEST,  SET  and  RESET,
 were  derived  from  the symbolic machine code used in assembly language
 [7].

 If a function designator is used as  a  parameter,  the  first  function
 identifier  must  correspond  to  an  execute instruction.  That is, the
 first byte of the instruction code must have the value #44X.  An example
 is the predeclared identifier EX (cf.  7.1).

           EXTERNAL <simple procedure heading>
     <simple procedure heading> ::=
           PROCEDURE <identifier> ( <integer register> )
 
 A procedure declaration serves to associate an identifier, which thereby
 becomes a procedure identifier, with a statement  (cf.   4.1)  which  is
 called  a  procedure  body.   This  identifier  can  then  be used as an
 abbreviation for the procedure body anywhere within  the  scope  of  the
 declaration.   When  the procedure is invoked, the register specified in
 parentheses in the procedure heading is assigned the return  address  of
 the invoking procedure statement.  This register must not be R0.
 
 If the symbol PROCEDURE is preceded by the symbol  SEGMENT,  GLOBAL,  or
 EXTERNAL,  the procedure body is compiled as a separate program segment.
 If the symbol is GLOBAL or EXTERNAL,  the  corresponding  identifier  is
 associated  with  the procedure segment to enable linking of segments in
 possibly different PL360 programs [8,9,12].  These symbols have no other
 influence  on  the  meaning  of  the  program  with  the  exception   of
 restricting the scope of GOTO statements (cf.  4.2, 6.4 and 10.4).  If a
 base  register is specified in the procedure heading, the procedure body
 is compiled using the specified register for the  program  segment  base
 register  (cf.   4.2);  otherwise,  the current program base register is
 used (usually this is R15, however, cf.  10.1.5).   This  register  must
 not  be  R0.   When the procedure is invoked, the specified (or assumed)
 base register is assigned the entry point address.
 
 The  instructions  associated  with  the  statement  of  both  a  simple
 PROCEDURE  and  COMMON  PROCEDURE  are  local  to  the  program  segment
 containing these procedure declarations.  However,  a  COMMON  PROCEDURE
 also  declares  the procedure identifier as an additional entry point to
 the program segment.  Such entry points are normally  called  upon  from
 separately compiled programs through an EXTERNAL PROCEDURE declaration.
 
 Examples:
           PROCEDURE NEXTCHAR(R3);
           BEGIN IF R5 < 71 THEN R5 := R5 + 1 ELSE
                BEGIN R0 := @CARDS;  READ;  R5 := R5--R5;
                END;
                IC(R0,CARD(R5));
           END

           BEGIN R0 := A(R1);
                   FOR R2 := R1 + 4 STEP 4 UNTIL N DO
                   IF R0 < A(R2) THEN BEGIN R0 := A(R2);  R3 := R2;  END;
                   R2 := A(R1);  A(R1) := R0;  A(R3) := R2;
           END
 
 
           EXTERNAL PROCEDURE SEARCHDISK (R14) BASE R12; NULL;
 
 Note:  The code corresponding to a procedure body  is  terminated  by  a
 branch-on-register  instruction  specifying  the  register designated in
 parenthesis in the procedure heading.  A procedure  statement  places  a
 return  address  in this register when invoking the procedure.  In order
 to return properly, the programmer must either not change  the  contents
 of that register, or explicitly save and restore its contents during the
 execution of the procedure.

     <procedure statement> ::= <procedure identifier> !
          <procedure identifier> ( <integer register> )
 
 The procedure statement invokes the  execution  of  the  procedure  body
 designated by the procedure identifier.  A return address is assigned to
 the  register  specified  in  the  heading  of  the designated procedure
 declaration.  If an integer  register  is  specified  in  the  procedure
 statement,  on  return  from  the  procedure the contents of the invoked
 procedure's program base register (usually R15) are transferred  to  the
 specified  integer  register  and  the  condition  code  is  set  by the
 transfer.  This facilitates the convention of passing  return  codes  in
 the  invoked  procedure's  program base register (usually R15, cf.  8.1,
 10.1.5).

 This section describes a set of global procedures written in PL360 which
 perform commonly needed tasks.  These  subroutines  are  predeclared  as
 external  procedures in the PL360 compiler.  In all cases, the procedure
 linkage is done with register R14, and R15 should contain the address of
 the  entry  point  upon  entry.   At  Stanford,   the   linkage   editor
 automatically  adds  the  required  subroutines  if  you  are  using the
 cataloged procedure PL360CG.
 
 
 9.1  Standard Procedures
+9.1  Standard Procedures
+9.1  Standard Procedures
 
 A set of standard procedures is defined for elementary unit record input
 and output operations (the first set below),  for  elementary  disk  and
 tape  input  and  output  operations  using sequential files (the second
 set), and for ease in  communicating  with  the  operating  system  (the
 last).  The implicit procedure declarations are as follow:
 
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE READ (R14) BASE R15;  NULL;
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE WRITE (R14) BASE R15;  NULL;
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE PAGE (R14) BASE R15;  NULL;
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE PUNCH (R14) BASE R15;  NULL;
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE PRINT (R14) BASE R15;  NULL;
 
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE OPEN(R14) BASE R15; NULL;
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE GET(R14) BASE R15; NULL;
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE PUT(R14) BASE R15; NULL;
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE KLOSE(R14) BASE R15; NULL;
 
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE CANCEL(R14) BASE R15; NULL;
 
 Suitable externally compiled or assembled routines must be  provided  in
 the link/loading process; the specifications of these routines are:
 
     READ  Read an 80 character record from the system input data set and
           assign that record  to  the  memory  area  designated  by  the
           address  in  register  R0.   Set the condition code to 2 if no
           record could be returned due to  an  end  of  file  condition;
           otherwise, to 0.  (ABEND 95 or 96)
    WRITE  Write a 133 character record to the system listing  data  set.
           A   132  character  record  is  taken  from  the  memory  area
           designated by the address in register R0 and  prefixed  by  an
           appropriate  carriage  control character.  A control character
           indicating a new page is used after 60 lines have been written
           on a page, otherwise a control character indicating  the  next
           line is used.  The first  line  is  written  on  a  new  page.
           (ABEND 95)
     PAGE  Give the next output record transmitted  by  a  WRITE  to  the
           system  listing  data set a control character indicating a new
           page.
    PUNCH  Write the 80 character record designated  by  the  address  in
           register R0 to the system punch data set.  (ABEND 95)
    PRINT  Write the 133 character record designated by  the  address  in
           register  R0  to  the  system  listing  data set.  The calling
           program provides  a  USASI  control  character  as  the  first
           character.  (ABEND 95)
B                                 9-1
1    OPEN  At entry, register R0 must be 0 if the file is to be an output
           file or 1 if the file is to be an  input  file.   Register  R2
           must contain the address of an 8-byte area containing a unique
           file  name.  (This is taken as the ddname in an OS environment
           and as the symbolic file name in a DOS environment.) In an  OS
           environment,  register  R1  must  contain  the  address  of  a
           100-byte  full  word-aligned  area  which, following the open,
           will contain the data control block.  In  a  DOS  environment,
           register R1 must contain the address of a separately assembled
           DTF  table  which  describes the file.  The file is made ready
           for input/output  operations.   All  registers  are  restored.
           (ABEND 97)
      GET  At entry, register R1 must contain  the  address  of  a  table
           which describes the file.  (In an OS environment this table is
           called  the  data control block and in a DOS environment it is
           called the DFT table.) Upon return, register R1  contains  the
           address  of  the  next logical record in the file.  (The first
           call of GET returns with the  address  of  the  first  logical
           record.) When an end-of-file is reached, the condition code is
           set  to 2; normally it is set to 0.  All registers, except R1,
           are restored.
      PUT  At entry, register R1 must contain  the  address  of  a  table
           which  describes  the file.  Upon return, register R1 contains
           the address of an area in which the next logical record to  be
           output is to be built.  All other registers are restored.
    KLOSE  At entry, register R1 must contain  the  address  of  a  table
           which  describes  the  file.  The corresponding file is closed
           and no further input-output operations can be  performed  with
           it  unless  it  is  opened  again.   In an OS environment, the
           contents of register R0 denoted  by  (R0)  is  also  an  input
           parameter  to  this subroutine:  if (R0) = 0 , the DISP option
           of  the  DD  statement  is  used  to  determine  final  volume
           positioning; if (R0) <= 0 , the volume is  positioned  at  the
           end  of  the data set.  If (R0) > 0 , the volume is positioned
           at the beginning of the data set.  All registers are restored.
 
    CANCEL The job, including all future job steps, is cancelled.
 
 
 All of these procedures assume that register R13 contains the address of
 an 18 word save area (cf.  4.4) and all registers  are  restored  before
 return.   Each  of the data sets is opened upon initial reference and is
 closed by the operating system at the end of a job step.
 
 
 9.2  Number Conversion Procedures
+9.2  Number Conversion Procedures
+9.2  Number Conversion Procedures
 
 The two subroutines described below  are  used  to  convert  the  EBCDIC
 representation  of  a  number  into  an  internal representation of that
 number,  or   vice-versa.    A   slightly   more   conventional   number
 representation is used by these routines than that of the PL360 language
 (cf.  3).  The numbers must satisfy the following syntax:
B                                 9-2
1
    <long complex number> ::= <long real number> + <imaginary number> L
    <complex number> ::= <real number> + <imaginary number>
    <imaginary number> ::= <real number> I ! <integer number>  I
    <long real number> ::= <real number> L ! <integer number> L
    <real number> ::= <unscaled real> ! <unscaled real> <scale factor> !
         <integer number> <scale factor> ! <scale factor>
    <unscaled real> ::= <integer number> . <integer number> !
         . <integer number> ! <integer number> .
    <scale factor> ::= ' <integer number> ! ' <sign> <integer number>
    <integer number> ::= <digit> ! <integer number> <digit>
    <sign> ::= + ! -
 
 Numbers are interpreted according to the conventional decimal  notation.
 A  scale  factor  denotes an integral power of 10 which is multiplied by
 the unscaled real or integer number preceding it.  A number can have  no
 embedded blanks and must be terminated by a blank.  These procedures are
 predeclared in a manner similar to those described in Section 9.1.
 
 
 The parameter passing conventions for the two conversion subroutines are
 as follows:
 
 VALTOBCD This procedure converts an internally stored value to an EBCDIC
          representation.  At entry,
 
          R1 contains the address of an area to receive the EBCDIC
             representation.
          R2 indicates the type:
               1 = integer
               2 = real
               3 = long real
               4 = complex
               5 = long complex
          R3 contains the field length (>= 1)
 
          The value to be converted is in R0, F0, F01, F0 and F2, or  F01
          and F23, depending on the type (in that order).
 
          A return code is left in R15:
             0 -> successful conversion
             1 -> field size too small
             2 -> invalid field size
          When the field size is too small  to  receive  the  value,  the
          field is filled with stars (*).
 
          All registers, except R14 and R15, are preserved.
 
 BCDTOVAL This procedure converts an EBCDIC representation of a number to
          an internal number.  At entry,
 
          R1 contains the address of the EBCDIC representation (possibly
             preceded by blanks)
          R2 indicates type (see VALTOBCD)
 
          The resulting value is left in R0, F0, F01, F0 and F2,  or  F01
          and F23, depending upon the type.
B                                 9-3
1
          A return code is left in R15:
              0 -> successful scan
              1 -> invalid character in input string
              2 -> missing "I" on imaginary part
              3 -> nonblank terminator
              4 -> number scanned is not assignment compatible
                   (e.g., a decimal point is found when R2 = 1)
              5 -> integer too large
 
          Upon  exit,  R1  contains  the  address  of   the   terminator.
          Registers R2-R13 are restored.
 
 
 9.3  Data Manipulation Procedures
+9.3  Data Manipulation Procedures
+9.3  Data Manipulation Procedures
 
 The first procedure described in this section does an  in-core  indirect
 sort using logical comparisons.  The second companion routine searches a
 sorted list for a specified element.   Neither procedure is predeclared.
 
 SHELSORT This procedure sorts character data.  The Shell Sort  technique
          is used.  At entry, registers R0-R3 must be set as follow:
 
          R0 = the number of items to sort
          R1 = the address of the index array
          R2 = the number of the first byte of the key in each
               record on which the sort is to be done (R2 >= 1)
          R3 = the number of bytes in the key on which the sort
               is to be done
 
          The index array is a list of  4-byte  integers  containing  the
          address  of the items to be sorted.  The actual sort is done on
          the elements of the index array and not the records themselves.
          That is, only the order of the elements of the index  array  is
          modified  by  the  procedure.   All  registers, except R14, are
          restored.
 
 BISEARCH This procedure locates an element in a sorted list.  At  entry,
          registers R0-R4 must be set as follow:
 
          R0 = the number of entries in the sorted table
          R1 = the address of the index array (see SHELSORT)
          R2 = the number of the first byte of the key field in
               the records
          R3 = the number of bytes in each key field
          R4 = the address of the key for which you are looking
 
          At exit, R1 contains the address of an  element  in  the  index
          array  that  points  to a record that contains the desired key.
          If no match is found, R1 = 0.
 
          All registers, except R1 and R14, are preserved.

          of line spacing.
 
 $EJECT   This directive is equivalent to $PAGE.

 $BASE=xx This  directive  must  precede  the  first  non-control   card.
          Program  segments following this directive are compiled with xx
          taken  as  the  program  base  register.   This  includes  main
          programs, global procedures, segment procedures,  and  external
          procedures  (which  do  not  specify BASE).  Procedure calls to
          such segments automatically set the specified base register  to
          the entry point address.  The decimal number xx must be between
          01 and 15 .  Programs which are statements must not be compiled
          with base registers 13 or 14.  The initial option is xx=15, and
          all  predeclared  external  procedure  declarations always have
          base register  R15.   It  is  recommended  that  this  compiler
          directive  only  be  used  for  programs  which make use of SVC
          instructions that do not preserve the contents of register R15.

          member  of  a  partitioned  data  set  is to be copied into the
          compilation.  The compiler temporarily suspends input from  the
          standard  input  medium and continues compilation with the data
          set defined by the $COPY control card.  When end-of-information
          is encountered on that data set, compilation continues from the
          standard input with the card image  immediately  following  the
          $COPY  control  card.   Note:  $COPY is ignored in the data set
          being copied, i.e., $COPY may not nest.  As many $COPY  control
          cards  as  desired  may  occur  in  the  standard  input.  When
          compiling under ORVYL, ddname or member is assumed  to  be  the

 10.1.8  Conditional Compile Directives
+10.1.8  Conditional Compile Directives
+10.1.8  Conditional Compile Directives
 
 At the start of compilation of each program  (cf.   4.1),  an  array  of
 flags  is  reset  by  the  compiler.   The following directives use this
 array.  The array flags are specified by individual  characters  in  the
 directives,  and any characters may be used, including blank.  Upper and
 lowercase characters are considered equivalent.  The directives must  be
 in uppercase in columns 1 through 4 on the control card.
 
 $SET a      where 'a' is any character in column 6.
             This directive sets the 'a' flag.
 
 $IFT a b    where 'a' is any character in column 6, and 'b' is any char-
 $IFF a b    acter in column 8.
             These directives examine the 'a' flag.  If the 'a'  flag  is
             set  for  $IFT,  or  reset for $IFF, this directive takes no
             action and compilation continues normally.
 
             If the 'a' flag is reset for $IFT,  or  set  for  $IFF,  the
             compiler  skip-reads  source cards until a $END directive is
             encountered  with  its  'b'  character  matching   the   'b'
             character  of  the $IFT or $IFF.  Compilation then continues
             from that point.
 
             Note:  '$IFF a b' is an unconditional skip to  '$END  b'  if
             '$SET  a' has occurred.  '$IFT a b' is an unconditional skip
             to '$END b' if '$SET a' has not occurred.
 
 $END b      where 'b' is any character in column 6.
             This directive terminates $IFT or $IFF directives.

 10.4  Compiler Object Program Output
+10.4  Compiler Object Program Output
+10.4  Compiler Object Program Output
 
 The  PL360  compiler  is  designed  to  be  used  in  conjunction   with
 link/loader programs which resolve symbolic cross-references between the
 segments  of one or more programs.  Examples of programs capable of such
 resolution are the MTS loader [8], the IBM OS linkage editor  or  loader
 [9], and the IBM DOS linkage editor [11].  The remainder of this section
 uses the terminology of these programs.
 
 The output of the PL360 compiler is a sequence of object modules.   Each
 object module contains a single control section corresponding to a PL360
 segment.   It consists of 80 character records in the standard format of
 external symbol dictionary  (ESD),  text  (TXT),  relocation  dictionary
 (RLD) and an end (END) (cf.  [10] and Appendix B).
 
 Every PL360 segment (except a dummy data segment) is associated with  an
 object module in the following fashion:
 
    1.  If the symbol SEGMENT appears  in  the  SEGMENT  declaration,  an
        object  module  is produced for this segment; the control section
        name is generated by the compiler as described below.
    2.  If the symbol GLOBAL  appears  in  the  segment  declaration,  an
        object  module  is produced for this segment; the control section
        name is the first 8 bytes of  the  identifier  appearing  in  the
        declaration.
B                                 10-6
1   3.  If the symbol EXTERNAL occurs  in  the  segment  declaration,  no
        object  module  is  produced;  instead  the  first 8 bytes of the
        identifier in the declaration is assumed to  be  the  name  of  a
        control  section  independently generated and is used to indicate
        this in the object module created for the segment containing  the
        external declaration.
    4.  If the symbol COMMON appears in the segment declaration  then  an
        object module is created in the form of a labeled or blank common
        control  section  according  to  whether  the  common declaration
        contains an identifier or not.
 
 In all cases a control section has a single entry point; the entry point
 name and the control section name are identical.  In the case of a PL360
 program which is a statement, a transfer address to the entry  point  is
 provided  in  the END card of the object module for the implicit segment
 corresponding to this statement.  This transfer address  is  used  by  a
 loader to determine where to begin execution.
 
 The task of the  linkage  editor/loader  includes  matching  global  and
 external   declarations,   inserting   absolute  address  constants  and
 completing tables of  segment  base  addresses,  contained  within  each
 control  section  for a program segment, in accordance with the external
 symbol dictionary and relocation dictionary generated  by  the  compiler
 for that control section.
 
 For PL360 programs which are statements, control section names generated
 by the compiler for SEGMENT declarations are of the form  SEGNnnn  where
 nnn  is  the decimal internal segment number.  If the PL360 program is a
 global procedure, the first three characters of the procedure identifier
 (extended on the right by NN if necessary) are  used  in  place  of  the
 characters  'SEG'.   These naming conventions may be overruled by use of
 the compiler directive $XYY# (cf.  10.1.4).
 
 Each END card of the object module output of the compiler has  the  name
 "PL360" followed by the date and time of compilation.

 Although  PL360  was  designed  for  writing  logically   self-contained
 programs,  it  is  possible  to  communicate  with  separately  compiled
 programs  if  appropriate  linkage  and coding conventions are observed.
 These conventions are summarized below.
 
 
 11.1  Calling External Routines from PL360
+11.1  Calling External Routines from PL360
+11.1  Calling External Routines from PL360
 
 Addresses which correspond to external symbolic names and which  are  to
 be  supplied  by  linkage  editing  can  be specified by the external or
 common declarations of PL360.  Entry to  the  block  containing  a  data
 segment declaration causes the specified base register to be loaded with
 the  corresponding  address.   External  names  appearing  in  procedure
 declarations  are  assumed to designate entry points to subroutines.  In
 such declarations, the procedure body is normally  the  statement  NULL.
 The  call  of  the  external  procedure  P2  from  the  procedure  P1 is
 equivalent to the following 360 Assembler coding:
 
       USING P1,15
       ...
       L     l,=V(P2)
       DROP  15
       BALR  n,l
       USING *,l
       L     15,=A(P1)
       USING P1,15
       DROP  n
 
 This linkage implies the following restrictions upon the called routine:
 
     1.  At entry, the base register specified (or assumed)  in  the
         external  procedure declaration (l) contains the address of
         the entry point, unless l = n.
     2.  At  entry, the register specified in the external procedure
         declaration (n) contains the return address.
     3.  Before  return, the return address must be restored to that
         designated register.
 
 Any additional, non-conflicting conventions may be  established  by  the
 programmer.
 
 If the called procedure (P2) uses  R15  to  return  information  to  the
 calling  routine  (P1),  the procedure statement in P1 is usually of the
 form P2(Rm) , indicating that the return linkage must move the  contents
 of  R15  to  Rm , thus setting the condition code before re-establishing
 the base address of P1 in R15.  The equivalent 360 Assembler coding  for
 this  type of call differs from that already given only in the last four
 lines which become
 
       LTR   m,15
       BALR  15,0
       USING *,15
       L     15,=A(P1)
       USING P1,15
B                                 11-1
1OS type linkages are facilitated by the fact that if the  calling  PL360
 program  is a statement, the first 18 words of the implicit data segment
 (base register R13) are available for use as a save area (cf.  4.4), and
 by the  @@  operator  which  facilitates  the  construction  of  OS-type
 parameter lists at compile time.
 
 
 11.2  Requesting Supervisor Services
+11.2  Requesting Supervisor Services
+11.2  Requesting Supervisor Services
 
 SVC instructions are available in PL360 programs  through  the  function
 statement.   It should be noted, however, that in many operating systems
 the contents of R15 are destroyed by execution of some SVC instructions.
 In such cases, it is essential that saving and immediately restoring R15
 be explicitly programmed.  This tedious job of preserving  the  contents
 of  the program base register can be avoided by using the $BASE compiler
 instruction (cf.  10.1.5), or by explicitly specifying a  base  register
 in the procedure heading (cf.  8.1).
 
 
 11.3  Calling PL360 Procedures from External Routines
+11.3  Calling PL360 Procedures from External Routines
+11.3  Calling PL360 Procedures from External Routines
 
 Symbolic names and corresponding addresses to be made known to  routines
 external  to  the  PL360  program are specified by the global and common
 declarations of PL360.  Global names specified in procedure declarations
 are associated  with  the  corresponding  procedure  entry  point.   The
 external  invocation  of  PL360  procedures  must  satisfy the following
 restrictions:
 
 1.  At entry to a PL360 procedure, the procedure base register  (usually
     R15,  but cf.  8.1, 10.1.5) must contain the procedure entry address
     and the register specified in the procedure declaration must contain
     the return address.
 2.  At exit from a correct PL360 procedure, the  register  specified  in
     the procedure declaration will contain the return address.
 
 In addition, the following points should be noted:
 
 1.  If the PL360 program was compiled from a block  and  not  a   global
     procedure declaration,
 
     a. the symbolic name  of  the  entry  point  will  normally  be
        SEGN001,  the  symbolic  name  of  the implicit data segment
        (with base register  R13)  will  normally  be  SEGN000  (cf.
        10.1.4);
     b. the return register will be R14
     c. at entry, R13 must contain the address of an  18  word  save
        area, if the $OS option is in effect (cf.  4.4, 10.1.3)
     d. at exit, all registers are restored from this save area with
        R15 set equal to zero (R15=0)
 
 2.  Global and external names violate the rules of scope established  by
     the  PL360  block  structure (cf.  2.2.1, 4).  By pairing global and
     external  declarations,  a  name  can  be  given  arbitrary   scope.
     Recursive  procedures  and  co-routines can be programmed using this
     feature;  however,  this  ability  should  be  used  carefully   and
     sparingly.

 Consider the following example:
 
 GLOBAL PROCEDURE p1 (R1) BASE R7;      The procedure p2 can  be  entered
    BEGIN GLOBAL DATA d1 BASE R10;      with  the  base register for data
       INTEGER a;                       segment  d1  incorrectly  loaded,
       COMMON PROCEDURE p2 (R2);        since it is  possible  to  bypass
       BEGIN  R0 := a;                  the  entry code of the block con-
       END;                             taining the base declaration.  In
       COMMON PROCEDURE p3 (R2);        procedure p3, however, the exter-
       BEGIN EXTERNAL DATA d1 BASE R10; nal declaration  causes  register
          INTEGER a;                    loading,   but  all  declarations
          R0 := a;                      must be  repeated.   In  general,
       END;                             procedures   which   are   to  be
       R0 := a + 1;                     entered independently  should  be
    END.                                declared   as  separate  programs
                                        whenever possible.
 
 It should be noted that the registers specified in corresponding  global
 and   external  procedure  declarations  must  be  identical  while  the
 registers specified in corresponding global, external, and  common  data
 segment declarations may be different.
 
 Also note that when common and external procedures  are  paired,  return
 registers  must  be  identical  and  any  base register specified in the
 external declaration must match the  base  register  of  the  global  or
 segment procedure containing the common procedure declaration.  Thus,
 
     EXTERNAL PROCEDURE p2 (R2) BASE R7; NULL;
 
 would be the proper declaration for p2 in a separately compiled  segment
 considering the above example.

+           SECTION 12.  PL360 AS AN ORVYL LANGUAGE PROCESSOR
 
 This Section contains a brief narrative description of how one uses  the
 interactive  version  of  PL360  which runs under the ORVYL time-sharing
 monitor  [12].   This  version  is  made  possible  through  a   special
 ORVYL-PL360  interface  module  written  in  Assembly Language using the
 ORVYL macro instructions [12].
 
 
 12.1  Using the PL360 Compiler with ORVYL
+12.1  Using the PL360 Compiler with ORVYL
+12.1  Using the PL360 Compiler with ORVYL
 
 This Section assumes that the ORVYL system is  being  used  at  Stanford
 where the ORVYL-PL360 compiler is saved as an ORVYL unload file.  To use
 it, just type:
 
           ? PL360
 
 You will then receive the message:
 
           -WELCOME TO PL360, Joe User
           DECK?
 
 If your account has been activated for ORVYL files, then  you  can  type
 "YES" and PL360 will respond with:
 
           FILE NAME?
 
 You should then type the name of an ORVYL file  in  which  PL360  should
 place the object modules from the subsequent compilation.  This file can
 be  either  new or old.  Appending " SCR" to the file name will cause an
 old file to be scratched for reuse; otherwise, you will be prompted:
 
           SCRATCH?
 
 A "NO" response will cause the file naming process to be repeated.   The
 next thing PL360 asks is:
 
           LISTING?
 
 If you respond "YES", then you will again be asked to  supply  an  ORVYL
 file to receive the PL360 Compiler list output.  PL360 then asks:
 
           -?
 
 You can now type WYLBUR commands which will be passed to and executed by
 WYLBUR.  You can continue to  pass  commands  to  WYLBUR  (for  example,
 collect  lines,  edit  lines,  use  files,  copy files, etc.) until your
 WYLBUR working data set contains the PL360 program(s).   You  then  type
 "COMPILE"  immediately after a -?  prompt and PL360 will begin compiling
 the program(s) contained in your WYLBUR working data set.
 
 Any error messages and the line on which they occur  are  typed  at  the
 terminal  as  the compilation proceeds.  Each time a segment is closed a
 message is typed at the terminal.  When compiling from a WYLBUR  working
 data set, the compiler terminates at the end of the data set and types:
 
           -LEAVING PL360
B                                 12-1
1You can type in a program directly by responding "COMPILE  X"  to  a  -?
 prompt, where X represents any non-blank character.  PL360 responds:
 
           BEGIN TYPING PL360 PROGRAM
           -?
 
 You can now type in a PL360 program and each line will  be  compiled  as
 you go.  Unfortunately, if you make a mistake, you must start over since
 the  old  lines  are  not saved.  Also, leading blanks are stripped from
 each input line.  For these reasons, it is usually best to compile  from
 a WYLBUR working data set.  When typing the program in directly, you can
 leave  PL360  at  any  time by typing "/*" or by simply hitting the ATTN
 button at the terminal.
 
 As you are leaving PL360, ORVYL core memory  is  automatically  cleared.
 The  WYLBUR  working  data  set  is not cleared.  If the program you are
 compiling has numerous errors and you wish to  suppress  the  typing  of
 error  messages  at the terminal, then simply hit the ATTN button at the
 terminal (except in response to a prompt).  PL360 will then ask:
 
           DO YOU WANT FURTHER ERROR MESSAGES TYPED?
 
 A "NO" will cause the compilation to  continue  with  no  further  error
 messages  typed  at  the  terminal.   A  "YES" will cause compilation to
 continue as before.  In either case, the listing produced in  the  ORVYL
 file (if any) will be unaffected.
 
 After leaving PL360, you can retrieve the object deck by typing:
 
           GET <file name> CARD CLEAR
 
 You can retrieve the listing by typing:
 
           GET <file name> PRINT CLEAR
 
 The listing has 133-byte records, the first byte of which is a  carriage
 control  character.   Thus,  when  the  listing  is printed offline, the
 following WYLBUR command should be used:
 
           LIST OFF BIN xxx UNN (0)
 
 The (0) part of the LIST command causes the first byte to be treated  as
 a  carriage control character.  The resulting line printer listing looks
 like a batch PL360 compilation listing.  The ORVYL version of PL360  has
 several   advantages:    Waiting  for  the  batch  queue  is  completely
 eliminated.  Errors are printed at the terminal, and thus can usually be
 fixed immediately and another compilation can be made  in  a  minute  or
 two.   Paper  is  saved  since  listings  with  errors are seldom listed
 offline.  Finally, the ORVYL version of the runtime library can be  used
 to  run  and test the program immediately at the terminal.  In this way,
 ORVYL's debugging tools can be used and debugging takes far  less  time.
 Most  short  compilations  can be done in about a second or two of ORVYL
 compute time (less than 50[).  This is a significant savings over  batch
 compilations.   The  PL360  compiler,  which  is  about 3000 cards long,
 compiles in 37 seconds of ORVYL compute time at a cost of about $6.20.

 12.2  Input/Output Subroutines for Interactive PL360 Programs
+12.2  Input/Output Subroutines for Interactive PL360 Programs
+12.2  Input/Output Subroutines for Interactive PL360 Programs
 
 The standard input-output subroutines using the same linkage conventions
 as the READ and WRITE subroutines described in Section 9.1 are available
 for input-output operations directly at  the  terminal  when  running  a
 PL360  program  under the ORVYL monitor.  A description of the parameter
 passing conventions of these subroutines follows:
 
    READ  The address of a 132 byte input area should be provided  in  R0
          prior   to  calling  READ.   Upon  return,  all  registers  are
          preserved except R15 which contains  the  number  of  non-blank
          characters  typed  by the user (counting embedded blanks).  All
          details such as error messages  for  illegal  use  of  tabs  or
          waiting  too  long  to  respond  are  taken care of by the READ
          subroutine.  If the attention key is typed  with  no  preceding
          characters, the condition code is set to 2, otherwise it is set
          to 0.
 
    WRITE This subroutine works exactly like the subroutine described  in
          Section  9.1;  i.e.,  the  address of a 132 byte output area is
          passed through register R0 and all registers are preserved upon
          return.  The output area is typed at the terminal.
 
 The following discussion assumes that the ORVYL system is being used  at
 Stanford  where  the  ORVYL  READ  and WRITE subroutines and the library
 subroutines listed in Section 9 are stored in object module form in  the
 WYLBUR  file  T000.PL360.RUNLIB  on  SYS10.   To  run a PL360 program in
 ORVYL, just follow this simple process.   First,  compile  the  program.
 This  may  be  achieved either in batch or with the ORVYL version of the
 PL360 compiler.  The program must  be  a  statement  with  segment  name
 SEGN001  (cf.   Section 4).  Place the object module output of the PL360
 compiler in the WYLBUR working data set and type:
 
           COPY ALL TO END FROM &T000.PL360.RUNLIB ON SYS10
           LOAD TEXT
 
 Your program is now ready to be executed.  You could either  unload  the
 program  as  an ORVYL UNLOAD file and/or type the command ENTER to begin
 execution.
 
 Note that file I/O is not provided for in the ORVYL runtime routines.

+                     APPENDIX B.  THE OBJECT CODE
 
 Three principal postulates were used as guidelines in the design of  the
 language:
 
     1.  Statements which express operations on data must correspond
         to machine instructions in an obvious way.  Their structure
         must be such that they decompose into structural  elements,
         each corresponding directly to a single instruction.
     2.  No storage element of the computer should  be  hidden  from
         the  programmer.   In  particular,  the  usage of registers
         should be explicitly expressed by each program.
     3.  The control of sequencing should be expressible  implicitly
         by  the  structure  of  certain  statements  (e.g., through
         prefixing them with clauses indicating their conditional or
         iterative execution).
 
 The following paragraphs show the machine code into  which  the  various
 constructs  of  the  language  are translated.  The mnemonics of the 360
 Assembly language [7] are used to denote  the  individual  instructions.
 It is assumed that R15 is the program base register (cf.  4.2, 10.1).

12.         <K-register assignment><operator><A-primary>
 
 The code consists of a single instruction depending on the operator  and
 the  types of register and primary.  It is determined according to Table
 B.1, columns 2-7.
 
 
 3.         <A-cell> := <K-register>

 ci is determined by the i-th condition, which itself  either  translates
 into a compare instruction depending on the types of compared quantities
 (cf.   Table  B.1, column 9), or has no corresponding instruction, if it
 merely designates a relation or integer value.

 Rm is the register specified by the assignment, INC the  location  where
 the increment is stored, and LIM the location where the limit is stored.
 The  compare  instruction at L2 may be either a C, CH, or CR instruction
 depending on the type of limit.  Moreover, cond depends on the  sign  of
 the increment.

 It is assumed that the integer register enclosed in  parentheses  is  Rm
 and P is a label corresponding to the procedure identifier.

                         BAL  m,P
                         L    b,oldbase
 
 It is here assumed  that  P  designates  the  relative  address  of  the
 procedure  to  be  called  within  the  program  segment  in which it is
 declared, and  m  is  the  return  address  register  specified  in  its
 declaration,  and  b  is the program segment's base register.  The first
 version of code is obtained whenever the segment in which the  procedure
 is  declared  is  also the one in which it is invoked.  If the procedure
 call is of the form
 
            <procedure identifier>(Rn)
 
 then the instruction sequences become:
 
                         BAL  m,P
                         LTR  n,b
