ZAP                                                                 CMS command
 
The ZAP command is used to change or dump MODULE files, or members of LOADLIB
or TXTLIB libraries.
 
Input records control ZAP processing, and can be entered either from the
terminal (with the TERM option) or from a CMS file (with the INPUT option).

where:
 
libname1, libname2, libname3
     is the filename of a library containing the member you want to change or
     dump.  You can specify up to 3 library names.  This operand is valid only
     for LOADLIB and TXTLIB files.
 
MODULE
     specifies that the input will specify a file with filetype "MODULE" to be
     changed or dumped.
 
LOADLIB
     specifies that the input will specify a member of a library with the
     filetype "LOADLIB" to be changed or dumped.  At least one library name
     must be specified.
 
TXTLIB
     specifies that the input will specify a member of a library with the
     filetype "TXTLIB" to be changed or dumped.  At least one library name
     must be specified.
 
TERM
     specifies that control records should be read from the terminal.
 
INPUT filename
     specifies that control records should be read from the CMS file named
     <filename> ZAP *.  The file must be fixed records of 80 bytes.  The
     control records will be echoed to the output.
 
PRINT
     specifies that output should go to the printer.
 
NOPRINT
     specifies that output should go to the terminal.
 
Control records
---------------
 
Control records start with the first non-blank character of the input record,
and begin with a function name.
 
*
     specifies a comment, and is ignored.  At least one space is required after
     the asterisk.
 
DUMP modulename|membername [ALL|csectname [startaddr [endaddr]]]]
     specifies to dump the specified module or library member to the output
     The output can be limited to a specific CSECT or a portion of one,
     and defaults to the entire CSECT ("ALL").
 
     For TXTLIB libraries, the csectname is required and the membername is
     ignored.
 
NAME modulename|membername [csectname]
     specifies to change the specified module or library member.  If the
     csectname is omitted, the first CSECT in the module or member is changed.
 
     For TXTLIB libraries, the csectname is required and the membername is
     ignored.
 
BASE address
     specifies a base address to be applied to all subsequent VER and REP
     control records.  This record requires that a csectname was specified
     on the prior NAME record.
 
VER displacement data
VERIFY displacement data
     specifies to compare data to the content of the member at the specified
     displacement, relative to any prior BASE record.  If verification fails,
     the NOGO switch is set, and all REP records will be rejected.
 
     The displacement must be 2, 4, 6, or 8 hexadecimal digits in upper or
     lower case, and may be punctuated by commas.
 
     The data must be an even number of hexadecimal digits in upper or lower
     case, and may be punctuated by commas.
 
REP displacement data
     specifies to replace data in the content of the member at the specified
     displacement, relative to any prior BASE record.
 
     The displacement must be 2, 4, 6, or 8 hexadecimal digits in upper or
     lower case, and may be punctuated by commas.
 
     The data must be an even number of hexadecimal digits in upper or lower
     case, and may be punctuated by commas.
 
LOG fixnum [ZAPLOG|filetype [logdata]]
     specifies to create or update a log file.  The filename is the same as the
     modulename or membername from the prior NAME record, and the filetype is
     either specified or defaults to ZAPLOG.  If the filetype is specified,
     additional log data can be specified that will be written to the file.
 
END
     specifies to end the ZAP process.  This record is required, and must be
     the last record.
