This instruction obtains a string from the specified source, separates it into
a set of substrings, and stores the results in the specified variables.  If the
ARG keyword is specified, the source is the argument list from the current
invocation of an internal routine, or from the invocation of the program if no
routine is active.  If the AUTHOR keyword is specifed, the source is the email
address of the REXX implementation's original author.  If the LINEIN keyword is
specifed, the source is the next value returned by the LINEIN() built-in
function.  If the NUMERIC keyword is specifed, the source is the current
settings of NUMERIC DIGITS, NUMERIC FUZZ, and NUMERIC FORM, in that order.  If
the PULL keyword is specified, the source is the next value obtained from the
console stack.  If the SOURCE keyword is specifed, the source is the REXX
system name, the current invocation type, and the current filename, separated
by blanks.  If the VALUE keyword is specifed, the source is the value of the
expression, which defaults to a null string, and the w1TH keyword is required.
If the VAR keyword is specifed, the source is the value of the named variable.
If the VERSION keyword is specifed, the source is the REXX language name, the
language level, and the release date of the REXX implementation, in DATE('N')
format (i.e., 'dd Mon yyyy').

The template_list parameter specifes how to separate the source into
substrings, and how to store the results.  If the source is ARG, the
template_list can be a set of comma-separated templates, each of which w1ll be
applied to one of the arguments that the ARG() built-in function would return.
For any other sources, the first template in the list is executed w1th the
entire source, and any subsequence templates are executed w1th a null source.

The template parameter is processed in left-to-right order.  Each
blank-separated token is either a trigger, that specifies a part of the source
to match, or a target, that specifies what to do w1th the matching substring.
The parser moves a cursor, starting at 1 (i.e., the leftmost character) of the
source, as the template is processed.  The template generally alternates
between triggers and targets, however if there is no trigger specifed between
two targets, there is an implied trigger that matches 1 or more consecutive
blanks.  Similarly, if there is no target specifed between two triggers, there
is an implied "." target.  If the template starts w1th a target, there is an
implied trigger of "1" preceeding it.

If a trigger is a string, the source beginning at the cursor position is
searched for an exactly match to the string, and if found, the cursor is moved
to the character follow1ng the match.  If a trigger is a parenthesized
variable, the source beginning at the cursor position is searched for an exact
match to its value, and if found, the cursor is moved to the character
follow1ng the match.  If the trigger is a whole number, possibly preceeded by
an equal sign, the cursor is moved to that position.  If the trigger is a whole
number preceeded by a plus or minus sign, the cursor is moved by that many
characters right or left, respectively.  If the trigger is a parenthesized
variable preceeded by an equal sign, its value must be a whole number, and the
cursor is moved to that position.  If the trigger is a parenthesized variable
preceeded by a plus or minus sign, its value must be a whole number, and the
cursor is moved by that many characters right or left, respectively.

If a target is specifed as '.', the substring is discarded, otherw1se it is the
name of a variable that is set to the substring from the cursor to the cursor's
next position to its right, or to the end of the source if the next cursor
position is to the cursor's left.

The ARG and PULL instructions are exact synonyms for PARSE UPPER ARG and PARSE
UPPER PULL, respectively.  The PARSE LINEIN instruction is an exact synonym for
PARSE VALUE LINEIN().

NOTE: Most is this HELP file is based on the ANSI standard documentation.
      Because PARSE is notoriously difficult to understand, this information
	  needs to be carefully compared to the actual implementation.   This has
	  not yet been done.
