ADDRESS instruction and function

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRESS [(env [expr1]| [VALUE] expr2)]                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Temporarily or permanently change the destination environment for commands,
and possibly send a command to the new destination.

Variants:

	ADDRESS
		switches the destination environment to the previous environment.

	ADDRESS env
		switches the destination environment to the named environment.  The
		environment name is not evaluated, but rather taken as-is.

	ADDRESS env expr
		evaluates the expression and sends it to the named environment.  The
		environment name is not evaluated, but rather taken as-is.  The 
		previous environment remains current after this instruction.

	ADDRESS [VALUE] expr
		evaluates the expression and switches to the environment identified
		by its value.  The VALUE keyword may be ommited if the expression
		starts with a special character.

Examples:

	address command           /* future commands go to "COMMAND" environment */
	address cms 'BANANA'      /* tell CMS to search for and run BANANA */
	editor = 'XEDIT'; address value editor  /* == ADDRESS XEDIT */
	?editor = 'XEDIT'; address ?editor      /* == ADDRESS XEDIT */

| ADDRESS()                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

returns the name of the current command environment.

Examples:

	ADDRESS() == 'CMS'   /• perhaps •/
	ADDRESS() == 'XEDIT' /• perhaps •/
